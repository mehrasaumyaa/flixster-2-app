### Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app: not being able to connect to youtube due to network errors was a major one for me. So, sometimes the app would work and sometimes it wouldn't. 
Also, due to a numberformatexception, the app would keep closing. But, by going through the Logcat, I was able to figure it out in time.
